Getting started
New contributors should first read the contributing guide and learn the basics of PyTensor. Also they should read through some of the examples in the PyMC docs.

To be considered as a GSoC student, you should make a PR to PyMC / PyTensor. It can be something small, like a doc fix or simple bug fix. Some beginner friendly issues can be found here.

If you are a student interested in participating, please contact us via our Discourse site.

Projects
Below there is a list of possible topics for your GSoC project, we are also open to other topics, contact us on Discourse. Keep in mind that these are only ideas and that some of them can't be completely solved in a single GSoC project. When writing your proposal, choose some specific tasks and make sure your proposal is adequate for the GSoC time commitment. We expect all projects to be 350h projects, if you'd like to be considered for a 175h project you must reach out on Discourse. We will not accept 175h applications from people with whom we haven't discussed their time commitments before submitting the application.
