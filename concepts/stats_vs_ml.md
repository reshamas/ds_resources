# What is the difference between statistics and machine learning?


## Goals by Discipline

 * Statistician
    * predict an interaction between variables with some degree of certainty (we are never 100% certain about anything)

 * Machine Learners - want to build algorithms that predict, classify and cluster with the most accuracy
    * operate without uncertainty or assumptions, continuously learning in order to improve their accuracy score

## Culture Differences in Machine Learners' and Statisticians' Approaches

 * Statisticians
    * must understand underlying distribution of the population under study
    * must come up with parameters that will provide predictive power

 * Machine Learners
    * want to build algorithms that predict, classify and cluster with the most accuracy
